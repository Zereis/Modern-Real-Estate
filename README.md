# Modern-Real-Estate
Application for a real estate company who can maintain a register of their objects currently on the market. In this project I learned to implemenet features with the following techniques: 

- Uses the three principles of OOP, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism by implementing dynamic binding, interface, and abstract classes
- Create generic types.
- Use collections with generic objects.
- Apply serialization to persist data in binary and XML formats
- Applying a Three-Layer design, using class libraries (DLLs)
- Presentation Layer (PL)
- Business Logic Layer (BLL)
- Data Access Layer (DAL)
